My trip to Oklahoma was to come see Abike
It has gone really nicely up until this night when Abike started asking questions and not really wanting truthful answers
I have sworn to be truthful and not to patronize her
I found out that in an attempt to patronize her, I have in times past lied to her and that goes against everything I believe and stand for.I am not doing that anymore
If that comes at a cost, I am ready to pay the price
One thing I will not do anymore is lie or be diplomatic or frugal with the truth
I would rather have my integrity intact than lie to save face or keep up with a facade.
