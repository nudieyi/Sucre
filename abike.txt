Today started out like yesterday and there was a lot of crying and clarification seeking.
While it has not been a lot of fun, it is necessary.
It is almost always important to afford people the opportunity to express themselves, reflect and own the situation.
I do not intend to crash in on any part of that process. 
My trip to Oklahoma was to come see Abike
It has gone really nicely up until this night when Abike started asking questions and not really wanting truthful answers
I have sworn to be truthful and not to patronize her
I found out that in an attempt to patronize her, I have in times past lied to her and that goes against everything I believe and stand for.I am not doing that anymore
If that comes at a cost, I am ready to pay the price
One thing I will not do anymore is lie or be diplomatic or frugal with the truth
I would rather have my integrity intact than lie to save face or keep up with a facade.

I would rather be honest than seek to be in favor or in good books.
I understand that the truth can be hurtful, but I am never in doubt as to the liberating power of the truth.
It is also not noble to lie to the one you love, you keep hurting them and depriving them of their power of choice

In my opinion, we were able to talk through many subjects of interest for bith parties and subsequently make peace with ourselves.
